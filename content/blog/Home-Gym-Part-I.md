## Headings

So today is Australia Day, not that it really means that much to me now a days.. but that's blog post for another day. Today I want to talk about my home gym! I'm a passionate weightlifter. It began with my health, diagnosed with PCOS which means I have a predisposition for developing diabetes and susceptible to whole list of other uncomfortable symptoms. The endocrinologist I went to at the time was insistent that I needed to ingest a daily dose of corticosteroids for the rest my life in order to manage to symptoms... you know ignoring the long list of similar side effects that the corticosteroids themselves would cause if taken long term. There had to be a better way. Diet? Exercise? Lifestyle? Stress???? That's when I discovered weightlifting which can generally be broken down into three distinct and popular styles. Olympic weightlifting, powerlifting and bodybuilding. I have utter admiration and respect for individuals that are able to snatch or power clean their own body weight. Unfortunately without proper guidance and technique the risk of personal injury is just too high for my liking, so powerlifting is an acceptable alternative. 

Despite having cultivated a consistent habit of lifting heavy things and putting them down again at 3-4 times a week for the last 10 years the lockdown has completely changed everything! Disregarding the fact that I also moved to a neighbouring country and made some significant changes to my lifestyle I haven't been able to attend a gym since March 2020. It's been difficult and i've definitely noticed a significant difference in my health, physique and ability to manage stress. I moved into an old farmhouse in central Germany owned by my partner in August 2020.

With plenty of space and spare rooms there were no reasons against building a home gym. It was always a personal dream and all I really needed was enough space for a squat rack, barbell and olympic weight plates! No longer would I need to put up with listening to roided up gym bros grunting through their 10 rep military press with 20kg dumbbells or have to wait for someone to finish their bicep curls in the squat rack.

The room we would turn into a gym room was called a "Sommerkueche" which was in a separate building on the property. It was initially with all sorts of rubbish.... a Wurstkessel? Quite literally a huge metal or porcelain barrel/vessel for.. boiling sausages? Really old ovens, window panes, furniture and super furry walls, gross.
