## Headings

Despite having cultivated a consistent habit of lifting heavy things and putting them down again at 3-4 times a week for the last 10 years the lockdown has completely changed everything! Disregarding the fact that I also moved to a neighbouring country and made some significant changes to my lifestyle I haven't been able to attend a gym since March 2020. It's been difficult and i've definitely noticed a significant difference in my health. 

I moved into an old farmhouse in central Germany owned by my partner in August 2020. With plenty of space and spare rooms there were no reasons against building a home gym. It was always a personal dream and all I really needed was enough space for a squat rack, barbell and olympic weight plates!

The room we would turn into a gym room was called a "Sommerkueche" which was in a separate building on the property. It was initially filled with all sorts of rubbish like a Wurstkessel. Quite literally a huge metal or porcelain barrel/vessel for boiling sausages I believe. Really old ovens, window panes, furniture and super furry walls.
